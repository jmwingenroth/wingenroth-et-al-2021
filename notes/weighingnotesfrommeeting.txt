Candace weighing protocol notes:

- for the first timestep, zeroed scale between every filter
- up to timestep 6 or 7, zeroed scale every 3 filters
- after that, once per timestep
- no zeros after timestep 7
- closed door before taking reading
- closed door for zeros


Idea for dealing with residual curve:

- Drop first few timesteps

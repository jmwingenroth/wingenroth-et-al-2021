I messed around with using the 'Geosciences' LaTeX format on TexMaker. It was a headache. What finally worked was using Latex + Bibtex + Latex (x2) + a bunch of other converters to get to PDF.

I'll work in the default article format throughout the revision process instead, as a time saver. When it comes time to submit, I'll either use Overleaf (where the format is hosted and works well), or I'll re-download the template and use the Quick Build setting above.

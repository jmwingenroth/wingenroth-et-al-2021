Currently planning to submit to Geosciences special issue in November 2020

I messed around with using the 'Geosciences' LaTeX format on TexMaker.
 It was a headache. What finally worked was using Latex + Bibtex + 
Latex (x2) + a few other converters to get to PDF.

I'll work in the default article format throughout the revision process
instead as a time saver. When it comes time to submit, I'll either use 
Overleaf (where the format is hosted and works well), or I'll 
re-download the template and use the Quick Build setting above.

Overleaf works great with the Geosciences format. I've been using it for months now. 

Currently, the planned draft anatomy is (approximately):
- Front matter  1 page
- Intro         1.5 pages
- Methods       5.5 pages
- Results       3.5 pages
- Discussion    TBD but 2ish pages
- Back matter   0.25 pages
- References    2-3 pages

Total:          17 pages probably

Methods is a bit too long, Intro could be a bit longer
